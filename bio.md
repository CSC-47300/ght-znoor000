Syllabus Qs
-----------------------
1. What on the syllabus are you most interested in working on?
2. What on the syllabus do you find confusing/unclear? 
3. What on the syllabus scares you? 


1. From the syllabus, I am most interested in working on a collaborative website with classmates 
and their unique ideas.

2. The most confusing/unclear subject matter to me is that of the organization of the software in 
class. i'm not totally clear on what everything is necessary for.

3. The scariest thing about the syllabus is the project tracking system, i'm not familiar with that 
either. I wouldn't want my grade to be scaled down nor affected negatively because i'm not sure whether my 
commits are too big or small.
